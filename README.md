# dscripts
So far this is a repository for bulk of Python scripts for data science.

It started after Girija Ravishankar persuaded me to take part in one of the Kaggle challenges 'for fun of learning'.

Despite (self-proclaimed) knowledge of algortihms, we immediately faced elementary 'real-world' problems, e.g. not being able to reliably load 1Gb CSV data table on our laptops within a Python notebook.

So with that little data munging problem we begin this repository. Perhaps it'll end up being useful for something else too.
